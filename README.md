# Welcome!
I am a data science graduate student at Northeastern Universityâ€™s Roux Institute. My skills include data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization with an emphasis on Python and JavaScript tools and geospatial datasets. I have experience in education and environmental advocacy, including leadership experience coordinating small teams and serving on boards.

**I am seeking internship/co-op opportunities for summer/fall 2023.**
