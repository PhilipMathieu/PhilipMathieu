# Welcome!
I am a data scientist at IDEXX, one of the world's largest veterinary health technology companies. My skills include data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization with an emphasis on natural language processing (both traditional methods and AI/LLM-driven). In my personal life, I volunteer with Sierra Club Maine, and am generally interested in using technology to improve advocacy and government transparency.
