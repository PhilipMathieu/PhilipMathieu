# Welcome!
My name is Philip Englund Mathieu (he/him/his). I am a current student in the Master of Science Data Science program at Northeastern University's Roux Institute in Portland, Maine. I also work full time for the Cape Elizabeth Land Trust, where I coordinate educational programming with the school and greater community.

## [View My Resume](./Philip%20Mathieu%20-%20Resume%20CV%202022.pdf)
I am currently open to summer internships or longer-term positions to begin in summer 2022. Preference for adjacency to the environmental world, including but not limited to remote sensing, geospatial data processing, drone programming, policy analysis, and even IOT.

## Coming Soon
- Thinking about adding a section here to inject my recent plays on my favorite music app
- (Possibly related to the above) setting up a basic automation server to avoid paying for IFTTT (and learn something too)
-
